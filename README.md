## Deployment

### Claude.ai (User Skills)

1. Go to **Settings → Profile → Custom Skills** (or equivalent)
2. Upload the entire `nis2-navigator/` folder structure
3. The skill will auto-trigger on "NIS2", "BSIG", "BSIG-neu", "NIS2UmsuCG", "Annex I/II", "essential entity", or "Art. 21 gap analysis"

### Claude Code / Custom MCP Setup

1. Copy the `nis2-navigator/` folder to your skills directory:
   ```bash
   cp -r nis2-navigator/ /path/to/your/skills/user/nis2-navigator/
   ```
2. Ensure the skill is registered in your configuration

## Usage

### Quick Start

Describe your organisation:

> "We're a German cloud-services provider with 80 employees and €15M turnover.
> Do we fall under NIS2? If yes, give me a gap analysis against Art. 21 and a
> 12-month roadmap."

The skill will classify scope, run the gap analysis, and produce a phased roadmap.

### Trigger Phrases

- "NIS2" / "NIS-2" / "BSIG" / "BSIG-neu" / "NIS2UmsuCG"
